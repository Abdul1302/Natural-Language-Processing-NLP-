# NLP Preprocessing and Embedding Techniques
This repository contains a comprehensive overview and implementation of various Natural Language Processing (NLP) preprocessing steps and encoding techniques. The focus is on transforming raw text data into meaningful numerical representations that can be used for machine learning models.

## Introduction
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a critical area in the field of data science and machine learning. This repository provides a hands-on guide to essential NLP preprocessing steps and various encoding techniques. These methods are fundamental for converting textual data into numerical formats that can be processed by machine learning algorithms.

# Preprocessing Steps
The preprocessing steps include:

Tokenization: Splitting the text into individual words or tokens.
Lowercasing: Converting all characters in the text to lowercase to ensure uniformity.
Stopword Removal: Removing common words that do not contribute much to the meaning of the text (e.g., "and", "the", "is").
Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their root form to ensure consistency (e.g., "running" to "run").

## Encoding Techniques
1. Bag of Words (BoW):
The Bag of Words model converts text into a fixed-size vector by counting the frequency of each word in the text. This simple yet effective method is often used for text classification tasks.

2. N-grams:
N-grams are a contiguous sequence of n items from a given sample of text. This technique captures the context of words by considering the combination of adjacent words. For example, bigrams (2-grams) and trigrams (3-grams) are common choices.

3. TF-IDF:
Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a statistical measure used to evaluate the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). TF-IDF scores help in identifying the most relevant words in the text.

## Embedding with Word2Vec
Word2Vec is a popular embedding technique that represents words in a continuous vector space where semantically similar words are close to each other. There are two main architectures for training Word2Vec models:

### Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW)
In the CBOW model, the context (surrounding words) is used to predict the target word. This approach is efficient and works well with smaller datasets.

### Skip-Gram
The Skip-Gram model does the opposite of CBOW. It uses the target word to predict the context (surrounding words). This model is better for larger datasets and can capture more nuanced relationships between words.
